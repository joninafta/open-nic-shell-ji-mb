# MCP Server Integration Test

This file is used to test if GitHub Copilot can access the OpenNIC MCP server.

## Test Questions for Copilot

1. **Filter Pipeline Analysis**: What are the main components of the OpenNIC filter_rx_pipeline module?

2. **Requirements Compliance**: Can you check if the current implementation meets the OpenNIC requirements?

3. **SystemVerilog Package Issues**: Are there any issues with the packet_pkg.sv file structure?

4. **Test Coverage**: What tests are available for the filter pipeline?

5. **Build Configuration**: How should I configure the Makefile for Verilator simulation?

## Expected Behavior

When the MCP server is properly connected, GitHub Copilot should be able to:
- Access project-specific context about OpenNIC
- Provide detailed analysis of SystemVerilog modules
- Reference specific files and requirements
- Suggest improvements based on the codebase

## Configuration Status

- ✅ MCP Server Build: `/Users/jonafta/Dev/open-nic-mcp/build/index.js`
- ✅ VS Code MCP Configuration: `.vscode/mcp.json`
- ✅ Settings Configuration: `.vscode/settings.json`
- ✅ Copilot MCP Extension: `automatalabs.copilot-mcp`

## Testing

Try asking GitHub Copilot about OpenNIC-specific topics to verify the MCP integration is working.
